                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
                    simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
                    over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                    professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                    looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
                    through the cites of the word in classical literature,
                    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                    from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
                    et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory
                    of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
                    The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
                    amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
